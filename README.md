| [Service Criticality Analysis](https://github.com/rml-lee/Excel-Service-Criticality-Analysis) | Risk Management and Business Continuity Planning | As a Data Analyst Intern for the Fulton County Sheriff's Office IT Department, I contributed to the development of a Critical Systems Application Catalog, creating a centralized repository for online services and tools. I assisted in gathering data on various applications, evaluating their criticality, and devising guidelines to address redundancies. By constructing a detailed dataset from this information, I performed a criticality analysis that has become a crucial component of the office's risk assessment and has notably improved operational efficiency.
| [Video Game Sales Analysis](https://github.com/rml-lee/Excel-Video-Games-Project) | Entertainment and media, with specific focus on retail and e-commerce, consumer behavior, and market analysis within the video game industry. | I was curious about which video games are topping the charts across all platforms. I also wanted to know which platform is leading in global software sales. To explore this, I used Microsoft Excel to analyze the cleaned video game sales and ratings dataset from my previous [SQL project](https://github.com/rml-lee/MYSQL-Tableau-Video-Games-Project). In this project, I utilized pivot tables and created visualizations to help uncover the answers to these questions.
| [US Debt Tracker Analysis](https://github.com/rml-lee/Excel-US-Debt-Tracker-Project) | Finance | I took a deep dive into the public and governmental debt data for a debt agency in DC. I calculated the annual debt percentage changes and identified which months had the highest and lowest increases in total debt. This helped the agency get a clearer picture of debt trends and improve their forecasting and planning.
| [Bus Breakdown and Delays Analysis](https://github.com/rml-lee/Excel-Bus-Breakdown-and-Delays-NYC-Project) | Transportation & Logistics | The New York Division of Transportation wants to boost the efficiency and reliability of the city's bus system, which has been plagued by frequent breakdowns and delays. I analyzed the provided data to pinpoint the main causes of these issues and how they vary. This included identifying the most common reasons for delays and breakdowns, examining how delay times differ by bus company and borough, and finding out if certain days of the week are linked to more frequent problems. This analysis aimed to help improve the city’s public transportation and make commuting more reliable.
